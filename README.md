# Masternode Infra

A simple POC project that features a high availability crypto currency masternode IAC via Terraform. The goal was to provide a machine that would run with the hosted service, while ensuring it could never have two instances running at the same time (which would have come at the cost of penalties from the crypto protocol), all while ensuring maximum availability, including disaster recovery.
